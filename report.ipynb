All predictions are influenced by points that are \"too far\" from the one we want to get a prediction for, and start to go towards the __average of the training set__. This is evident when using $k = N = 27$, which means that all predictions always use all points in the training set. Due to this fact, predictions made in this setting are always exactly the same: the average of the training set."
